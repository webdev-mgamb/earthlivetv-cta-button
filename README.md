# EarthTV Animated CTA Button

A lightweight, performance-focused CSS animation for the "Take Me Anywhere" feature.

## 🚀 Features
*   **Zero Dependencies:** Pure HTML/CSS. No Lottie, Three.js, or GSAP.
*   **Mobile Optimized:** Custom JavaScript handler ensures animation plays on tap before navigation.
*   **Parallax Effect:** Dual-layer texture animation (Land + Clouds) for pseudo-3D depth.
*   **Responsive:** Scaling vector/percentage layout.

## 📂 File Structure
*   `index.html` - The markup.
*   `style.css` - All animations and visual styles.
*   `script.js` - Mobile interaction logic.
*   `assets/` - Optimized textures.

## 🛠 Integration
1.  Copy the CSS from `style.css` into your main stylesheet.
2.  Place the HTML anchor tag where needed.
3.  Ensure `assets` folder path is correct relative to the CSS.
